This project requires **Python 3.7.1** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

### Code

This project contains three files:

- boston_housing.ipynb: This is the main project file where work was performed.
- housing.csv: The project dataset.
- visuals.py: This Python script provides supplementary visualizations for the project. Do not modify.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the project directory `boston_housing/` and run one of the following commands:

```jupyter notebook boston_housing.ipynb```

```ipython notebook boston_housing.ipynb```  

This will open the Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data

The dataset used in this project is included with the scikit-learn library ([`sklearn.datasets.load_boston`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_boston.html#sklearn.datasets.load_boston)). You do not have to download it separately. You can find more information on this dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing) page.
